If you did not do the previous task, go to https://hkey0.github.io/EclipseBridge/testnet/ and bridge sepoia eth to eclipse testnet.

If you are clueless about how to get sepoliaEth, Ai is your companion. You can use tombot; one being developed by a friend
I will be glad to receive feedback on it. So you are free to DM and tell me whatever you feel about it.
